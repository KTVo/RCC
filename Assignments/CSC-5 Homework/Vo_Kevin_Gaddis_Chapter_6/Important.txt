Dear Dr. Lehr:

I apologize that these programs are not within a menu under a switch statement. I have have been trying for hours, figuring out a way around the "unexpected token errors" by 
checking if all the curly brackets and semicolons are in the correct spots. The program seems to operate fine on their own; however, when I try to incorporate them into the 
switch statement it failed to run.

Sorry,
       Kevin Vo
